about=This plugin generates a three light exposure hillshade (shaded relief by combining three light exposures) using
    as input LiDAR classified data (ASPRS classification / *.laz, *.las formats) or a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) in
    raster format (GEOTiff / ASCII). The three light exposures combining method is based in Gantenbein (2012): <(http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2012/1171/)>

    You can use LasPy Library to process LiDAR data (ASPRS las format). Now user can generates a Terrain Hillshade and Surfaces Hillshades (from version 2.3.0.)
    The Surface Model (DSM) is generated using LiDAR first returns only.
    
    If you uses as input LiDAR data, note that plugin uses LASTools library and FUSION LDV.

    For more information see readme.md at plugin folder (see Installed version at the end)
