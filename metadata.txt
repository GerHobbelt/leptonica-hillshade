description= Plugin to generate a three light exposure hillshade (shaded relief by combining three light exposures)
version=2.01.85
author=PANOimagen S.L.

about=This plugin generates a three light exposure hillshade (shaded relief by combining three light exposures) using 
    as input LiDAR classified data (ASPRS classification / *.laz, *.las formats) or a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) in 
    raster format (GEOTiff / ASCII). The three light exposures combining method is based in Gantenbein (2012): <(http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2012/1171/)>
    
    If you uses as input LiDAR data, note that plugin uses LASTools library and FUSION LDV.
    
    For more information see readme.md at plugin folder (see Installed version at the end)
