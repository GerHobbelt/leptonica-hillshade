For processing LiDAR data (allways in ASPRS format [*.laz, and *.las]) you must to install some external dependecies:

You can use LasPy Library (BSD License) to generate a three exposure hillshade from *.las ASPRS format:

    To install LasPy Library, you must launch the following line at OSGEO Shell:

        > python -m pip install laspy
    
    LasPy documentation is avaible at:
    
        https://github.com/laspy/laspy

    If you need to process compressed LiDAR data [*.laz format] and you want to use Free Open Source Software you can unzip laz format to las format using LasZip Library:
    LasZip is LGPL License and you can found it at: https://www.laszip.org/

    
    
    
    
The other options you have, is to process directly *.laz format LiDAR file using LASTools Libray and FUSION LDV, to use this softwares:

    First of all it's necesary activate the Processing plugin that allows the processing options. (Plugins > Manage and install plugins... > Processing)

    If you have activated the Processing Plugin and the Batch Hillshader plugin does not detect it, restart QGIS

    # LASTools Library:

        Read the following lines that describes the steps for install and activate LASTools Library. 

        First of all, please read the LASTools License, you cant see at <https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/>
        and download the installer from the LASTools Library web site (<https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/>).

        Once the library is installed, open the LASTools folder, open the QGIS_toolbox folder and follow the steps 
        that are described in README.txt file.

        The last step is to activate the library in QGIS. Open QGIS, go to "Processing options" in menu "Processing > Options".
        Next expand Providers, Tools for LiDAR data, check the Activate option Check Box and set the folder of LASTools installation.

    # FUSION LDV:

        Read the following lines that describes the steps for install and activate FUSION LDV.

        First of all, please read the FUSION LDV License, you cant see at <http://forsys.cfr.washington.edu/fusion.html>
        and download the installer from the FUSION LDV website (<http://forsys.cfr.washington.edu/fusion.html>).

        Once the software is installed, activate it in QGIS as like as LASTools Library. Open QGIS, go to "Processing options" 
        in menu "Processing > Options". Next expand Providers, Tools for LiDAR data, check the Activate option Check Box and set 
        the folder of FUSION LDV installation.
