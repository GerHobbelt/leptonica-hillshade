  abstract = {Modern computer displays and printers enable the widespread use of color in scientific communication, but the expertise for designing effective graphics has not kept pace with the technology for producing them. Historically even the most prestigious publications have tolerated high defect rates in figures and illustrations [Cleveland, 1984],and technological advances that make creating and reproducing graphics easier do not appear to have decreased the frequency of errors. Flawed graphics consequently beget more flawed graphics as authors emulate published examples. Color has the potential to enhance communication, but design mistakes can result in color figures that are less effective than grayscale displays of the same data.},

A linear equation is derived to provide source location parameters of a 2D magnetic body without a priori information about the nature of the source. Then using the source location parameters, the nature of the source can be ascertained. The method has been tested using theoretical simulations with random noise for two 2D magnetic models placed at different depths with respect to the observation height. In both cases, the method gave a good estimate for the location and shape of the sources. Good results were obtained on two field data sets.},

The technique utilizes the low-wavenumber content of the flight-line data to construct a smooth representation of the regional field at a scale appropriate to the line lengths of the survey. Levelling errors are then calculated between the raw flight-line data and the derived regional field through a least squares approach. Minimizing the magnitude of the error, with a first-degree error function, results in significant improvements to the unlevelled data. The technique is tested and demonstrated using three recent airborne surveys.},
