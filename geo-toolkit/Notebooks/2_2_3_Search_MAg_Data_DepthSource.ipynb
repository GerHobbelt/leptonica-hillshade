    "\n",
    "Here we apply the tilt-depth method discussed in [Section 2.1.5.](http://toolkit.geosci.xyz/content/Demos/SyntheticTiltDepth.html#synthetic-edge-detection-and-depth-to-source) to the Search Phase II magnetic data. Depth can be accurately derived from the tilt angle where contacts between magnetically contrasted geological units are vertical. Because of the typically complex nature of true geological contacts, calculated depths calculated from real magnetic data sets are usually approximations. The results should always be considered in light of expected geology, and ideally should be interpreted alongside geology, topographic data, and other geophysical data and models if these data are available.\n",

The window can be resized and moved anywhere over the data using the slider bars (East, North, Width, and Height). The default window is 30 km x 30 km in size, a size typical of surveys flown to explore magnetic responses at the exploration property, or district scale.\n",
