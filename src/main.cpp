 * This programm enables you to create a colored MNT map from a .txt file containing
 * GPS coordinates and depth.
 * It converts the GPS coordinates to cartesian (x,y), then it create a vector of pixels
 * containing the depth, and finally, it fills a .ppm file by pixels using the colormap Haxby
 * and a shading factor.

/**
* @file
* @brief This program creates a digital terrain model (DTM) from a dataset of GPS coordinates and depths.
* The DTM is represented as a matrix of pixels, each of which is assigned a color that represents the corresponding elevation in the terrain.
*
* The program first concatenates the path of the input data file with the name of the file, passed as an argument to the program.
* It uses an `std::ostringstream` to do this. The program then opens the file using an `std::ifstream`, and reads the GPS coordinates and depths from it.
*
* The program then converts the GPS coordinates to Cartesian coordinates using the `GPS_to_cartesian` function.
* Then the program indexes these Cartesian coordinates by modifying them to start at (0, 0) with function `indexing`.
* Then the program creates a vector of points containing x, y pairs, and uses this vector to create a map linking each point to its corresponding depth.
*
* The program then uses the Delaunay triangulation method to divide the point set into triangular facets. This is done using a library called delaunator.
*
* With these triangular facets, the program create pixels and creates a new matrix of pixels and fill it with the depth values, in order to create a matrix of pixels.
*
* Finally, the program applies a hillshading algorithm to the pixels matrix and creates a .ppm image file to represent the digital terrain model.
